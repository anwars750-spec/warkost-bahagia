# Warkost Bahagia — Project Checkpoint

## Active baseline

- Branch: `session/2a-customer-ui-polish`
- Source checkpoint: `032db5a71466e89bffe703775ae42e03b0411c51`
- Verified implementation commit: `cac62b9e79fccb7d552196509de44112fe14590f`
- Milestone: Customer UI Implementation — Homepage Only
- Status: **COMPLETED / VERIFIED**
- Verification date: 2026-10-03

## Scope completed

- Customer homepage desktop and mobile were aligned to the two approved design references.
- Customer header now exposes Notifikasi, Keranjang with item badge, Akun, and Bantuan while preserving the existing drawers and account flow.
- Brand logo, name, and tagline remain readable without mobile overlap.
- Active promotions use the existing server-side period logic and display through a responsive hero carousel.
- Homepage includes responsive heading, service benefits, menu search, Semua/Makanan/Minuman filters, and a Menu Pilihan section.
- Product cards use existing local demo assets, visual badges, responsive descriptions, price hierarchy, and existing quantity/cart state.
- Customer help exposes the configured WhatsApp chat and telephone actions.
- Mobile bottom navigation contains Notifikasi, Keranjang, Akun, and Bantuan.
- A floating cart summary appears above the mobile bottom navigation and retains the existing quick-cart drawer.
- Checkout, notification page, order page, account settings, address UI, customer session, pricing, promotion filtering, and backend behavior were not changed.

## Final verification

- Production build: **PASS**
- Full unit suite: **48/48 PASS**
- Targeted customer homepage browser test: **2/2 PASS**
  - Desktop Chromium: 1440 × 900
  - Mobile Chromium: 390 × 844
- Fresh SQLite demo database and readiness health check: **PASS**
- Logo/header, promo CTA, search, category filters, product images, quantity control, cart badge, cart drawer, help actions, and mobile bottom navigation: **PASS**
- Desktop and mobile horizontal overflow check: **PASS**
- Browser console/page errors in targeted successful flows: **NONE**
- Critical/High application bugs remaining in session scope: **NONE**
- Cross-role UAT and database recovery suites were not rerun because this session changed only customer homepage presentation and targeted browser coverage. Their VERIFIED source-checkpoint results remain unchanged.

## Primary files changed in this session

- `app/page.js`
- `app/style.css`
- `tests/uat/roles.spec.mjs`
- `PROJECT_CHECKPOINT.md`

## Guardrails preserved

- No Checkout, Notifikasi page, Pesanan page, Pengaturan Akun, or Alamat redesign.
- No Manager role or RBAC change.
- No role removal or Kasir change.
- No loyalty redesign or birthday voucher.
- No Google Maps API or API key.
- No pricing/checkout engine change.
- No backend refactor or dependency upgrade.
- No merge to `main`.

## Next-action gate

Do not open another milestone from this checkpoint without a new explicit scope. Use `cac62b9e79fccb7d552196509de44112fe14590f` as the verified functional baseline for the approved Customer Homepage implementation.
